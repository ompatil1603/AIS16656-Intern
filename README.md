# AIS16656-Intern
Day 1-
 
    i) First thing we learned, how to download Anaconda software. We download software from anaconda.org and complete rest of process to run software.
    ii) We explore Anaconda software and learned new softwares from it, like R software, Jupiter Notebook, Jupiter Lab, etc.
    iii) In Jupiter notebook we learned how to create jupiter notebook and how to run it.
         By the end of the day we learned a lot of things that will benefit us a lot for this internship and we learned how to do coding in Jupiter notebook.
         
Task 1-

     Task :-
     
     i) We learned  Operators. Operators we have Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparison, Logical, Identity, Membership and etc.Looked at some of these types and learned how to use         them.
     ii) After this we learned what is variable selection in python. We saw the different rules of how to create variables, how to write variable names.And also saw examples            of variable selection.
     iii) Then we learned what Data Types are. There are two types of data types, Mutable Data Types and Immutable Data Types. 1) Mutable Data Types include List, Set,
          Dictionary Data Types. And saw examples of each. 2) Immutable Data Types include Numerical, String and Tuple Data Types and saw some examples.

Task 2-

     Task :-

     i) In Task 2 we saw some different conditions like if, if else, if elif, etc. In these conditions we have seen how their syntax works. And learned when and why to use these condition.
     ii)Learned what Loops are. And saw 2 types of loops, for loop and while loop. We understand when to use for loop and while loop, and how to use it.


Task 3-

     Task :-

     i) It was statement regarding. In it we learned what Break, Pass and Continue statement are and how they are used in for loop and while loop. And from the name we can understand that what will be their work. Break is used to break a loop, etc
     ii) After this we learned what statistical user defined function is. A function was created using statistical concept in it. Just created a function using its formula to find the mean.
     iii) Later learned what Logical user defined function is. Using this concept, a function was created after understanding the logic behind any concept or any formula.

Task 4-

     Task :-

     NumPy Library: Basic, random(distributions and visualzation), universal functions

Task 5-

     Task :-

     i) Pandas series creation and operationds.
     ii) Dataframe creation using matrix, dictionary and to red csv and xlsx files.
     iii) Dataframe operarions od dateframe methods in pandas.
     iv)Selection in dataframe: rows or columns selection, delete, update, index, remove inedx, etc. operations between two rowsor columns in dataframe.
     v) Missing values: checking for missing values, dropping missing values, fill missing values.

Task 6-

    Task :-

    i) Matplotlib and Seaborn library for all type of ghraphical visualization.
       plots like- Line, Scatter, Bar, Histogram, Box, Heatmap, Count, Regression, Area, Pie, etc.\
       
Task 7- 
     
    Task : Case Study 1 Read data & import necessary libraries. 
    Data preprocessing. 
    Visualisation. 
    Model building. 
    Model evaluation. 
    comparison. 
    
 
Task 8 : 
      
    Power Bi Dashboard: create Dashboard using water quality prediction data. 
    
    
Task 9 : 

    Project : Project on Box Office Revenue Collection Predicition.
